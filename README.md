# Elementary School Coding Games

Collection of short video games I coded while in elementary school using the Processing language. The source code for each of the games can be viewed using the *View Source* button on the top right corner of the games' websites. 

- [**_Island - A Platformer:_**](https://www.ktbyte.com/projects/project/572921/island-a-platformer) You are trapped on an island and have to dodge enemies and leap between platforms to escape. Controls: Use space to jump, a/left arrow to move left, and d/right arrow to move right. Also make sure to keep an eye on the timer, because you'll lose if time runs out. 

- [**_River Raid:_**](https://www.ktbyte.com/projects/project/594531/river-raid) Inspired by Atari's classic River Raid, this is my personal take on the original game. While I didn’t make the original, this version was my own attempt to replicate its mechanics and design as a fun coding challenge.
Controls: Use the left/right arrow keys to steer, up/down arrows to change speed, and spacebar to shoot. To refuel, fly over fuel canisters to collect them; don’t shoot them!
