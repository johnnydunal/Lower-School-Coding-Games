# Elementary School Coding Games

Collection of short video games I coded while in elementary school using the Processing language. The source code for each of the games can be viewed using the *View Source* button on the top right corner of the games' websites. 

- [**_Island - A Platformer:_**](https://www.ktbyte.com/projects/project/572921/island-a-platformer) You are trapped on an island and have to dodge enemies and leap between platforms to escape. Use space to jump, a/left arrow to move left, and d/right arrow to move right.

- [**_River Raid:_**](https://www.ktbyte.com/projects/project/594531/river-raid) A shooter game based on shooting enemies while flying across a river.
